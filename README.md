### App.jsx

All Routing is handled here.

### Library.jsx

This component displays all saved recipes. Users can click on recipe cards to see recipe descriptions and they can add recipes to their meal plan by selected them.
When a user clicks on the **Create new recipe** button, they are redirected to the CreateRecipe.jsx. When a user clicks on the **generate grocery list** button, all items currently in the GroceryList DB table are removed, and the table is repopulated based on the selected recipes. User is then redirected to the GroceryList.jsx component.
